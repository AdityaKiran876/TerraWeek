What is Terraform and how can it help you manage infrastructure as code?
ans. Terraform is a tool with which we can build infrastructure without using the UI but using a language called HCL. With terraform we can create a blueprint of our infrastructure and can manage it.

Why do we need Terraform and how does it simplify infrastructure provisioning?
ans. We need terraform to build our infrastructure and save it as a code. With Terraform we can manage up our infrastructure as per our requirements without using the UI in the cloud services and also we can add various services whenever required. 
We can also make changes in the code and make new infrastrucutre.

How can you install Terraform and set up the environment for AWS, Azure, or GCP?
ans. To set up Terraform in AWS use these commands:
wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
To confirm the installation run this command- terraform --version

Explain the important terminologies of Terraform with the example at least (5 crucial terminologies).
1. Infrastructure as Code (IAC)--- IAC means creating infratructure using a coding language. The language is known as HCL(Hashicorp Configuration Language).
2. Infrastrucutre provisioning--- Infrastrucutre provisioning means creating Infrastrucutre in cloud services. It means setting up servers or any environment.
3. Providers--- Providers are used to intall the cloud dependencies to set up the infrastrucutre from our servers.
4. terraform init-- This command is used set up the backend and other dependencies to run the terraform files and create infrastructure.
5. Attributes-- Attributes are the specifications of our infrastrucutre resources whoch we want to set up.
